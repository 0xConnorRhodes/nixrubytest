1. create gemfile
2. `bundle lock` to create gemfile.lock
3. `bundix` to create gemset.nix
4. copy the default.nix from pry inside nixpkgs and change pname and exes
5. update shell.nix to call the package from default.nix


This *does* make the binaries executable, but does not make the package accessible from within a ruby script with `require httparty`.
